# Indian-Language-Speech-Recognition-


#### **Description:**
Developed a speech recognition system for Indian languages using deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project aimed to accurately transcribe spoken words from Indian languages by processing audio data into Mel spectrograms and training the CNN to classify them. The performance of the model was evaluated using accuracy metrics and confusion matrix to measure its classification effectiveness.

#### **Responsibilities and Accomplishments:**

- Collected and preprocessed a diverse dataset of Indian language speech samples, converting them into Mel spectrograms for CNN training.
- Developed and fine-tuned a CNN model to classify audio data based on Indian languages.
- Applied data augmentation techniques (noise addition, pitch shifting) to improve model robustness.
- Trained the model, optimized with dropout and batch normalization, and evaluated using Word Error Rate (WER).
- Leveraged transfer learning with pre-trained models to improve performance with limited data.
- Tested and validated the model with real-world speech data, achieving high accuracy.
- Documented the process for easy replication and future improvements.


#### **Skills Applied:**

- **Deep Learning:** Built and fine-tuned CNN models for speech recognition.
